# Skeleton action recognition 

## ðŸ“Œ&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction
This project aims to extend this template to action recognition tasks in video for skeleton data
by providing an implementation of models and datasets for the benchmarks tackling tasks in action segmentation. 

## Main Ideas For This Project 
- **Improve on available models**: this part will tackle the deep learning methods of this project which will focus on improving the best current models 
- **Task based training**: Implement the different tasks that action segmentation encompasses and allow for multi task training 
- **self supervised tasks**: Investigate self supervised tasks for skeleton data
- **Package**: extend the current template to be a proper package for action segmentation
